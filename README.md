# i3-config
A very simple configuration file for i3wm, a Window Manager software for Linux. For instructions on how to properly install i3, refer to https://i3wm.org/.

Obs: This configuration has a section for gaps, if you decide to use this part of the file, make sure to install i3-gaps, a fork from the original project the supports adding gaps between windows.
